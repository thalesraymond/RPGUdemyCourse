# RPGUdemyCourse

This is the code for the Unity project I made for the RPGUdemy course. The project is a simple RPG game that you can play in the Unity Editor. It is not meant to be a finished product, but rather a learning experience for myself and anyone else who might be interested in making a RPG in Unity.

## Features

- A simple inventory system that allows you to equip and unequip items
- A character class system that allows you to create different types of characters with different abilities and stats
- A skill system that allows you to learn and use different skills
- A quest system that allows you to progress through different quests and earn rewards
- A system for saving and loading game progress
- A system for generating randomized items and equipment

- Visual Studio 2022
